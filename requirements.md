# Requirements Specification for M6 Equipment Foundation

**EARS Notation Requirements for Equipment System Implementation**

---

## Equipment Slot Management

**REQ-EQ-001**: WHEN a player joins the game, THE SYSTEM SHALL load their equipment state from persistent storage and restore all equipped items to their respective slots.

**REQ-EQ-002**: WHEN a player attempts to equip an item, THE SYSTEM SHALL validate that the target slot is compatible with the item type and that skill requirements are met.

**REQ-EQ-003**: WHEN an item is successfully equipped, THE SYSTEM SHALL apply the item's stat bonuses immediately and trigger any equipment-specific effects.

**REQ-EQ-004**: WHEN a player unequips an item, THE SYSTEM SHALL remove stat bonuses and return the item to the player's inventory within 100ms.

**REQ-EQ-005**: WHEN equipment state changes occur, THE SYSTEM SHALL persist the changes to the database with optimistic locking to prevent conflicts.

## Item Templates and Data Management

**REQ-IT-001**: WHEN the server starts, THE SYSTEM SHALL load item templates from the database containing item types, stat bonuses, and requirements.

**REQ-IT-002**: WHEN an item template is referenced by player equipment, THE SYSTEM SHALL ensure the template exists and has not been corrupted.

**REQ-IT-003**: WHEN item template data is missing or corrupted, THE SYSTEM SHALL log the error and prevent equipment operations until resolved.

## Performance and Reliability

**REQ-PF-001**: WHEN equipment calculations are performed during tick processing, THE SYSTEM SHALL complete all operations within the 50ms tick budget.

**REQ-PF-002**: WHEN the player population exceeds 100 concurrent users, THE SYSTEM SHALL maintain 20Hz tick rate without equipment-related performance degradation.

**REQ-PF-003**: WHEN database operations timeout, THE SYSTEM SHALL retry with exponential backoff and failover to cached state.

## Equipment Cooldowns

**REQ-CD-001**: WHEN an item is equipped, THE SYSTEM SHALL enforce a cooldown period before the item can be used in combat or abilities.

**REQ-CD-002**: WHEN equipment cooldowns are active, THE SYSTEM SHALL provide accurate countdown timers to connected clients.

**REQ-CD-003**: WHEN a player disconnects during an equipment cooldown, THE SYSTEM SHALL persist the remaining cooldown time and restore it on reconnection.

## Data Integrity

**REQ-DI-001**: WHEN equipment data corruption is detected, THE SYSTEM SHALL isolate the corrupted data and continue operation with default equipment state.

**REQ-DI-002**: WHEN equipment state restoration fails, THE SYSTEM SHALL log detailed error information and notify administrators through monitoring systems.

**REQ-DI-003**: WHEN optimistic locking conflicts occur during equipment updates, THE SYSTEM SHALL retry the operation with fresh state and resolve conflicts automatically.

---

## Edge Cases and Error Conditions

**REQ-ERR-001**: IF a player attempts to equip an item they do not possess, THEN THE SYSTEM SHALL reject the operation and return an appropriate error message.

**REQ-ERR-002**: IF database connectivity is lost during equipment operations, THEN THE SYSTEM SHALL cache operations and replay them when connectivity is restored.

**REQ-ERR-003**: IF equipment template updates conflict with existing player equipment, THEN THE SYSTEM SHALL handle the migration gracefully without breaking player state.

**REQ-ERR-004**: IF concurrent equipment operations occur, THEN THE SYSTEM SHALL serialize operations per player to prevent race conditions.

---

## Testing Requirements

**REQ-TEST-001**: THE SYSTEM SHALL include unit tests covering all equipment operations with >95% code coverage.

**REQ-TEST-002**: THE SYSTEM SHALL include integration tests validating equipment persistence across server restarts.

**REQ-TEST-003**: THE SYSTEM SHALL include load tests validating performance under 100+ concurrent equipment operations.

**REQ-TEST-004**: THE SYSTEM SHALL include chaos tests validating equipment state integrity under network failures and database outages.

---

## Success Criteria Validation

Each requirement must be validated through:
- **Automated Testing**: Unit and integration test coverage
- **Performance Testing**: Load testing with synthetic users  
- **Manual Verification**: End-to-end testing through client interfaces
- **Monitoring**: Real-time validation of performance metrics

**Confidence Score**: 85% - Requirements are clear and testable, implementation follows established patterns in the codebase.
