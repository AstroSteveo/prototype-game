## Risk Management

### High-Priority Risks

**Equipment System Complexity**

- **Contingency**: Reduce scope to essential features only

**Database Performance Impact**
- **Risk**: Equipment queries impact database performance
- **Mitigation**: Early load testing, query optimization, indexing strategy
- **Contingency**: Implement caching layer, optimize query patterns

**Integration Challenges**
- **Risk**: Equipment system conflicts with existing systems
- **Mitigation**: Careful integration testing, incremental rollout
- **Contingency**: Feature flag for quick disable, rollback procedures

### Medium-Priority Risks

**Cooldown Timer Accuracy**
- **Risk**: Cooldown timers drift or become inaccurate
- **Mitigation**: Server-authoritative time tracking, validation tests
- **Contingency**: Reset cooldowns on detection of drift

**State Synchronization**
- **Risk**: Client-server equipment state becomes desynchronized
- **Mitigation**: Comprehensive state validation, automatic resync
- **Contingency**: Force client refresh on desync detection
