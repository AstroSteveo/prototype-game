# Summary

This document records the analysis and cleanup work around the legacy US-501 branches, ensuring the repository reflects the merged state and avoids stale references.

## Context

- Original work: US-501 — Save position and simple stat (Issue #27).
- Historical branch names observed:
  - `us-501-save-position` (remote)
  - `feat/us-501-save-position` (local, previously)
  - `code-code-us-501--save` (local, stale)
- Related pull request: PR #52 (merged on 2025-09-14T04:44:24Z).

## Findings

- PR #52 is merged into `main` and implements US-501 behavior.
- Issue #27 is closed (2025-09-14T05:05:42Z).
- Attempting to create a new PR from `us-501-save-position` failed with: "No commits between main and us-501-save-position", indicating the branch had no unique changes.

## Actions Taken

1. Verified PR and issue state via GitHub CLI.
2. Confirmed no diffs remained between `us-501-save-position` and `main`.
3. Deleted remote branch `us-501-save-position` and removed local `feat/us-501-save-position`.
4. Deleted stale local branch `code-code-us-501--save`.
5. Added this analysis document for visibility and future reference.

## Rationale

Removing redundant branches prevents confusion, keeps the repository tidy, and clarifies that `main` is the source of truth for US-501 functionality.

## Verification Notes

- `gh pr view 52` → state: MERGED; mergedAt: 2025-09-14T04:44:24Z
- `gh issue view 27` → state: CLOSED; closedAt: 2025-09-14T05:05:42Z
- `gh pr create --head us-501-save-position --base main --draft` → GraphQL: No commits between branches.

## Next Steps

- None required. This doc exists solely for traceability and audit.
