| **Authentication** | ‚úÖ Complete | 100% | Gateway/sim integration stable | Hardening for production |
| **Inventory/Equipment** | üìã Next (M5) | 0% | MVP vertical slice design | Week 2: Design complete |
| **Targeting & Skills** | üìã Planned (M6) | 0% | Tab-target & XP system design | Week 4: Development start |
| **Persistence Layer** | üìã Planned (M7) | 0% | PostgreSQL/Redis integration | Week 6: Implementation |
| **Performance** | ‚úÖ Strong | 90% | 20Hz tick stable, <250ms handover | Load testing under density |
| **Technical Debt** | üîÑ Ongoing | 60% | Inventory/equipment, targeting, DB | Address in M5-M7 features |

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Risks and Mitigations (Updated Sept 2025)

Based on roadmap planning meeting outcomes:

| Risk Category | Risk Description | Probability | Impact | Mitigation Strategy | Owner |
|---------------|------------------|-------------|--------|-------------------|-------|
| **Technical** | DB schema/migrations complexity | Medium | High | Technical design sessions for DB/inventory/skills | Tech Lead |
| **Capacity** | Team capacity for inventory/equipment feature | Medium | Medium | Schedule buffer time; prioritize MVP acceptance criteria | Project Lead |
| **Integration** | PostgreSQL setup for dev and CI | Medium | Medium | Early prototyping; dev environment parity | DevOps |
| **Performance** | Persistence layer latency impact | Low | High | <2s reconnect budget; Redis caching strategy | Backend Team |
| **Scope** | Feature creep in vertical slices | Medium | Medium | Strict MVP acceptance criteria; defer stretch goals | Product Owner |
| **Timeline** | 10-week delivery timeline | Medium | High | Incremental delivery; technical design up-front | All Teams |

### New Mitigation Actions
- **Week 0-1**: Schedule technical design sessions for DB/inventory/skills
- **Week 1**: Complete PostgreSQL setup for dev and CI environments
