# Roadmap Meeting Guide

This guide explains how to organize and conduct roadmap planning meetings for the prototype-game project.

## When to Hold Roadmap Meetings

Roadmap meetings should be scheduled:
- **Quarterly**: Regular roadmap reviews to assess progress and plan ahead
- **Before major releases**: To define scope and priorities for the next release
- **When strategic direction changes**: Market feedback, technical pivots, or stakeholder requirements shift
- **After significant milestones**: To reassess and adjust future plans based on learnings

## How to Schedule a Roadmap Meeting

### 1. Create the Meeting Issue
1. Go to the [GitHub Issues page](https://github.com/AstroSteveo/prototype-game/issues/new/choose)
2. Select **"Roadmap Planning Meeting"** template
3. Fill in the meeting date in the title: `roadmap: Next Release Planning - YYYY-MM-DD`
4. Complete all required sections in the template

### 2. Prepare for the Meeting
- Review the session guide: `docs/process/sessions/ROADMAP.md`
- Gather current progress data and metrics
- Collect user feedback and stakeholder input
- Prepare candidate feature list with effort estimates
- Review technical debt and infrastructure needs

### 3. Conduct the Meeting
Follow the structured agenda in `ROADMAP.md`:
- **Current State Assessment** (20 min): Review progress and challenges
- **Next Release Vision** (20 min): Define goals and success criteria
- **Feature Prioritization** (25 min): Select features based on impact vs effort
- **Planning and Timeline** (10 min): Estimate timeline and resources
- **Actions and Follow-up** (15 min): Assign ownership and next steps

### 4. After the Meeting
- Update the GitHub issue with meeting outcomes
- Update the [Game Roadmap Project](https://github.com/users/AstroSteveo/projects/2) board
- Create user stories for selected features
- Schedule follow-up planning sessions
- Communicate roadmap updates to stakeholders

## Meeting Participants

**Core Team**:
- Product Owner (PO): Scope, acceptance criteria, user value, roadmap clarity
- Technical Architect: System design, technical feasibility, infrastructure needs
- Development Lead: Implementation estimates, team capacity, technical risks
- QA/SRE: Quality requirements, testing strategy, operational considerations

**Optional Attendees**:
- Stakeholders with decision-making authority
- Subject matter experts for specific features
- Users or user representatives for feedback

## Success Criteria

A successful roadmap meeting produces:
- ✅ Clear release theme and objectives
- ✅ Prioritized feature list with rationale
- ✅ Realistic timeline with key milestones
- ✅ Identified risks with mitigation strategies
- ✅ Resource requirements and team assignments
- ✅ Updated project roadmap and board
