# ADR Peer Review Guidelines

This document outlines the process and standards for conducting peer reviews of Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) in the prototype game project.

## Purpose

Peer reviews ensure that ADRs:
- Address technical concerns comprehensively
- Consider implementation risks and mitigation strategies  
- Align with project constraints and objectives
- Provide clear guidance for implementation teams
- Follow documentation standards and best practices

## Review Process

### 1. Review Assignment
- ADRs in "Proposed" status require peer review before acceptance
- Reviews should be conducted by stakeholders with relevant expertise
- Multiple perspectives encouraged (architecture, security, operations, etc.)

### 2. Review Documentation
- Create review document in same directory as ADR
- Use naming convention: `{ADR-NUMBER}-{TITLE}-REVIEW.md`
- Follow structured review template (see Template section below)

### 3. Review Outcomes
Reviews should conclude with one of:
- **APPROVE** - ADR ready for acceptance
- **APPROVE WITH RECOMMENDATIONS** - Minor clarifications needed
- **REQUEST CHANGES** - Significant revisions required before acceptance
- **REJECT** - Fundamental issues require new approach

## Review Criteria

### Technical Architecture
- [ ] Problem statement clearly defined
- [ ] Solution approach well-justified
- [ ] Alternative options considered
- [ ] Technical feasibility assessed
- [ ] Performance implications analyzed
- [ ] Scalability considerations addressed

### Risk Management
- [ ] Failure scenarios identified
- [ ] Mitigation strategies defined
- [ ] Recovery procedures specified
- [ ] Security implications considered
- [ ] Operational impact assessed

### Implementation Guidance
- [ ] Implementation strategy clear
- [ ] Dependencies identified
- [ ] Testing approach outlined
- [ ] Rollout plan specified
- [ ] Success metrics defined

### Documentation Quality
- [ ] Writing clear and scannable
- [ ] Technical details accurate
- [ ] Cross-references appropriate
- [ ] Follows documentation guidelines
- [ ] Template structure followed

## Review Standards

### Thoroughness
- Address all major aspects of the ADR
- Consider both positive and negative consequences
- Evaluate implementation feasibility
- Assess alignment with project goals

### Constructiveness
- Provide specific, actionable feedback
- Suggest concrete improvements
- Balance criticism with acknowledgment of strengths
- Focus on technical merit, not personal preferences

### Clarity
- Use clear, professional language
- Structure feedback logically
- Prioritize issues by importance
- Provide rationale for recommendations

## Post-Review Process

### ADR Author Responsibilities
- Address high-priority feedback before implementation
- Update ADR based on review recommendations
- Respond to reviewer questions and concerns
- Update status to "Accepted" when ready

### Reviewer Follow-up
- Validate that feedback has been addressed
- Approve final ADR version
- Participate in implementation reviews if needed

## Review Index

| ADR | Title | Reviewer | Date | Status | Outcome |
|-----|-------|----------|------|--------|---------|
| 0002 | Cross-Node Handover Protocol | AI Agent | 2024-01-15 | Complete | Approve with Recommendations |

## Best Practices

### For Reviewers
- Read ADR completely before starting review
- Consider implementation team perspective  
- Validate against project constraints
- Look for missing considerations
- Provide constructive, specific feedback

### For ADR Authors
- Request reviews early in drafting process
- Address feedback promptly and thoroughly
- Update ADR status based on review outcomes
- Acknowledge reviewer contributions
