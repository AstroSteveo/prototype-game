# ADR 0003 Peer Review Summary

## Review Status: CONDITIONAL APPROVAL

**Recommendation**: Approve ADR 0003 with substantial modifications to reduce scope and risk.

## Key Findings

1. **Strong Foundation**: Consistent hashing approach is technically sound
2. **Overambitious Scope**: Tries to solve too many problems in one ADR
3. **Implementation Feasibility**: Current design too complex for initial deployment
4. **Integration Issues**: Insufficient analysis of existing codebase integration

## Required Changes Before Approval

### Critical (Must Fix)
- [ ] Remove dynamic rebalancing from initial scope
- [ ] Remove locality optimization from Phase 1
- [ ] Define simplified storage approach (file-based for dev, in-memory for tests)
- [ ] Add comprehensive error handling to code examples
- [ ] Define bootstrap and cold-start procedures
- [ ] Analyze integration with existing `spatial.CellKey` and `Engine` code

### Important (Should Fix)
- [ ] Clarify relationship with ADR 0002 handover protocol
- [ ] Define testing strategy for distributed scenarios
- [ ] Add performance benchmarks and validation approach
- [ ] Specify consensus mechanism for split-brain prevention

### Nice to Have (Could Fix Later)
- [ ] Add comprehensive monitoring strategy
- [ ] Define operational runbooks
- [ ] Plan capacity management approach

## Recommended Simplified Scope

**Phase 1: Basic Consistent Hashing**
- Static node assignments using consistent hashing
- Simple file-based assignment storage for development
- Integration with existing Gateway and Engine code
- Basic health checking and failover

**Phase 2: Production Readiness** (Separate ADR)
- Redis-based shared storage
- Comprehensive monitoring and alerting
- Advanced failure recovery

**Phase 3: Advanced Features** (Separate ADR)
- Dynamic load rebalancing
- Locality optimization
- Auto-scaling integration

## Validation Requirements

Before implementation begins:
1. **Performance Testing**: Validate latency claims with simulated cross-node scenarios
2. **Integration Testing**: Prove compatibility with existing handover protocol
3. **Failure Testing**: Demonstrate graceful degradation during node failures
4. **Code Review**: Review all implementation code examples for correctness

## Next Steps

1. **ADR Author**: Revise ADR 0003 to address critical issues (estimated 2-3 days)
2. **Architecture Team**: Review revised ADR in decision panel session
3. **Implementation Team**: Create prototype with simplified scope
4. **QA Team**: Define test strategy for distributed cell assignment
