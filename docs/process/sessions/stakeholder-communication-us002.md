# Stakeholder Communication - US-002 Roadmap Alignment Workshop Outcomes

**Date**: 2025-01-15  
**Workshop**: US-002 Roadmap Alignment Workshop  
**Audience**: Development Team, Project Sponsors, Stakeholders  

## Executive Summary

The US-002 Roadmap Alignment Workshop successfully completed comprehensive alignment between project vision, requirements, and roadmap for the next development phase. **All MVP milestones (M0-M5) have been completed successfully**, establishing a solid foundation for post-MVP development.

**Key Decision**: The next development phase will focus on implementing the **"Meaningful Loadouts"** design pillar through a structured 4-milestone approach (M6-M9) over 13-17 weeks.

## Workshop Outcomes

### ✅ Vision Validation
- **All 5 design pillars remain valid** and continue to guide technical decisions
- **"Meaningful Loadouts" pillar identified as next priority** after successful MVP completion
- **No conflicts** between current vision and post-MVP technical direction

### ✅ Requirements Alignment  
- **High-priority gaps clearly identified**: Equipment System, Skill Progression, Targeting System
- **Clear user story mapping** to technical implementation requirements
- **Phased approach confirmed** to manage system complexity and interdependencies

### ✅ Technical Readiness
- **MVP foundation is stable** and ready for post-MVP extension
- **Database schema can accommodate** equipment and skill progression requirements
- **Performance budget confirmed** for additional system complexity

## Post-MVP Development Plan

### Timeline: 13-17 Weeks (4 Milestones)

| Milestone | Focus Area | Duration | Key Deliverables |
|-----------|------------|----------|------------------|
| **M6** | Equipment Foundation | 4-5 weeks | Equipment slots, stat effects, persistence |
| **M7** | Skill Progression | 3-4 weeks | XP pipeline, skill gating, unlocks |
| **M8** | Targeting & Combat | 4-5 weeks | Target selection, damage types, combat resolution |
| **M9** | Integration & Polish | 2-3 weeks | UI integration, performance optimization |

### Success Metrics

**By M9 Completion, Players Will Be Able To**:
- ✅ Equip items in hands/armor slots with immediate stat changes
- ✅ Progress skills through gameplay actions and unlock new equipment options  
- ✅ Target enemies with clear difficulty indication
- ✅ Experience meaningful combat with equipment stats affecting outcomes

## Resource and Risk Management

### **Phased Risk Mitigation**
- **Equipment-first approach** reduces system complexity by building foundation before dependent systems
- **Performance validation during M6** ensures equipment system doesn't impact core simulation performance
- **Early UI prototyping** during M6 reduces M9 integration risk

### **Resource Requirements**
- **Backend development focus**: Primary effort on equipment, skill, and combat systems
- **Performance testing**: Specialized testing during M6 for encumbrance calculations
- **UI/UX design**: Early involvement during M6 for inventory interface design

## Stakeholder Actions Required

### **Immediate (Next Week)**
- **Development Team**: Begin M6 equipment system design sessions
- **Backend Team**: Create performance test plan for encumbrance calculations  
- **Project Sponsor**: Review and approve 13-17 week timeline commitment

### **Ongoing (Weekly Updates)**
- **Progress Reports**: Weekly status on M6-M9 milestone progress
- **Risk Reviews**: Bi-weekly assessment of equipment-skill system complexity
- **Stakeholder Updates**: Monthly summary of post-MVP development status

## Communication Schedule

| Frequency | Audience | Content | Format |
|-----------|----------|---------|---------|
| Weekly | Development Team | Progress on current milestone, blockers | Standup reports |
| Bi-weekly | Technical Leads | Risk assessment, technical decisions | Technical review |
| Monthly | Project Sponsors | Milestone completion, timeline adherence | Executive summary |
| Per Milestone | All Stakeholders | Milestone completion, next phase planning | Detailed report |

## Key Messages for Different Audiences

### **For Development Team**
- "MVP success validates our approach - now we build the progression systems that make it a game"
