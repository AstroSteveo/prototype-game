# Roadmap Alignment Workshop

## Purpose
A comprehensive workshop to ensure full alignment between vision, requirements, technical plan, and roadmap milestones across all stakeholders before the next release cycle.

This session differs from the regular [Roadmap Planning Meeting](ROADMAP.md) by focusing specifically on alignment verification and gap closure rather than routine planning.

## When to Conduct
- Before major release planning cycles
- When significant vision or architecture changes occur
- After onboarding new key stakeholders
- When identified gaps exist between vision and implementation
- As referenced in user stories like US-002

## Required Stakeholders
- **Product Owner (PO)**: Vision and user requirements
- **Technical Architect**: System design and feasibility
- **Gameplay Lead**: Game design and player experience
- **Networking Lead**: Performance and scalability
- **SRE/QA Lead**: Reliability and testing strategy

## Pre-Workshop Preparation

### Required Reading
- [Game Design Document](../../product/vision/game-design-document.md) - Vision and design pillars
- [Technical Design Document](../../architecture/technical-design-document.md) - Architecture and implementation
- [Vision-Requirements Traceability Matrix (VRTM)](../traceability/VRTM.md) - Current alignment status
- [Current Roadmap](../../product/roadmap/roadmap.md) - Milestones and timeline

### Pre-Work Assignments
- **PO**: Review VRTM for vision-requirement gaps
- **Architect**: Assess technical feasibility of roadmap items
- **Gameplay**: Validate user stories against design pillars
- **Networking**: Review performance targets and constraints
- **SRE/QA**: Evaluate testing coverage and reliability metrics

## Workshop Structure (3 hours)

### Phase 1: Alignment Assessment (45 min)

#### Vision Verification (15 min)
- Review design pillars against current implementation
- Identify any drift from original vision
- Confirm stakeholder understanding is consistent

#### Requirements Mapping (15 min)
- Walk through VRTM systematically
- Highlight gaps between user stories and technical systems
- Note any missing or obsolete requirements

#### Technical Feasibility Review (15 min)
- Assess roadmap items against technical constraints
- Identify architectural risks or dependencies
- Review performance targets and scalability assumptions

### Phase 2: Gap Analysis (60 min)

#### Documentation Gaps (20 min)
- Identify missing or outdated documentation
- Review broken references or inconsistencies
- Plan documentation updates and ownership

#### Implementation Gaps (20 min)
- Review VRTM status for incomplete mappings
- Identify technical debt affecting roadmap delivery
- Assess resource constraints and skill gaps

#### Process Gaps (20 min)
- Review decision-making processes
- Identify communication or coordination issues
- Assess milestone tracking and reporting effectiveness

### Phase 3: Resolution Planning (60 min)

#### Priority Setting (20 min)
- Rank identified gaps by impact and urgency
- Assign ownership for each high-priority item
- Set target resolution dates

#### Roadmap Adjustments (20 min)
- Propose changes to milestone timelines
- Adjust feature priorities based on gap analysis
- Update resource allocation plans

#### Action Planning (20 min)
- Create specific action items with owners
- Schedule follow-up reviews and checkpoints
- Plan stakeholder communication

### Phase 4: Commitments and Next Steps (15 min)
- Confirm all stakeholder commitments
- Schedule follow-up sessions
- Document decisions and rationale

## Workshop Outputs

### Updated Documents
- **VRTM Updates**: Reflect gap resolutions and new alignments
- **Roadmap Revisions**: Adjusted timelines and priorities
- **Action Items List**: Specific tasks with owners and deadlines
- **Risk Register**: Updated with identified alignment risks

### New Artifacts
- **Stakeholder Communication Plan**: How to share alignment decisions
- **Follow-up Schedule**: Regular check-ins and review sessions
- **Gap Resolution Tracking**: Progress monitoring for identified issues

### Decision Records
- **Alignment Decisions**: Key choices made during workshop
- **Priority Changes**: Rationale for roadmap adjustments
- **Resource Commitments**: Stakeholder capacity allocations

## Success Criteria
- [ ] All stakeholders demonstrate consistent understanding of vision
- [ ] VRTM shows clear mappings with minimal gaps
- [ ] Technical plan supports all prioritized user stories
- [ ] Roadmap timeline is realistic and achievable
- [ ] Clear ownership for all action items established
- [ ] Communication plan for broader team alignment created

## Follow-up Actions

### Immediate (Within 1 week)
- Update all referenced documentation
- Communicate decisions to extended team
- Begin work on highest priority action items
- Schedule first follow-up checkpoint

### Short-term (Within 1 month)
- Complete all high-priority gap resolutions
- Update project tracking systems
- Conduct first progress review
- Assess effectiveness of alignment improvements

### Ongoing
- Regular VRTM reviews during planning sessions
- Quarterly alignment health checks
- Continuous documentation maintenance
- Stakeholder feedback collection

## Integration with Existing Processes

### Relationship to Regular Roadmap Meetings
- Alignment workshops are deeper, comprehensive reviews
- Regular roadmap meetings handle routine planning and updates
- Workshop outputs inform subsequent roadmap planning sessions

### Connection to VRTM Process
- Workshops validate and update VRTM comprehensively
- Regular VRTM reviews maintain alignment between workshops
- Workshop gaps become VRTM action items

### ADR Integration
- Major alignment decisions may require new ADRs
- Existing ADRs inform workshop technical discussions
- Workshop outcomes may trigger ADR updates

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Stakeholder Availability
- **Problem**: Key stakeholders unavailable for full workshop
- **Solution**: Conduct pre-workshop 1:1s and focused follow-ups

### Scope Creep
- **Problem**: Workshop expands beyond alignment into detailed planning
- **Solution**: Use parking lot for non-alignment items, schedule separate sessions

### Documentation Gaps
- **Problem**: Referenced documents are outdated or missing
- **Solution**: Pre-workshop documentation sprint, assign documentation owners

### Technical Complexity
- **Problem**: Technical discussions too detailed for all stakeholders
- **Solution**: Technical pre-sessions, simplified summaries for broader group
