- **Assess**: Does current technical direction support the vision?
- **Document**: Any required updates to core product positioning

#### Requirements Gap Analysis (15 min)  
- **Review**: VRTM current status and identified gaps
- **Prioritize**: Which gaps block next milestone vs. future phases?
- **Validate**: Are acceptance criteria measurable and testable?

#### Technical Readiness Review (15 min)
- **Assess**: Infrastructure capacity for next phase requirements
- **Review**: Outstanding technical debt impact on roadmap
- **Validate**: Architecture decisions support vision pillars

### Phase 2: Alignment Deep Dive (90 minutes)

#### Vision ↔ Requirements Mapping (30 min)
- **Map**: Each design pillar to specific requirements and user stories
- **Identify**: Requirements not traced to vision elements
- **Resolve**: Conflicting or competing requirements
- **Output**: Updated requirements priority and scope

#### Requirements ↔ Technical Design Mapping (30 min)  
- **Validate**: Technical systems support all prioritized requirements
- **Assess**: Implementation complexity vs. business value trade-offs
- **Identify**: Technical risks that could impact requirement delivery
- **Output**: Updated technical milestone definitions

#### Technical Design ↔ Roadmap Mapping (30 min)
- **Align**: Milestone sequencing with technical dependencies
- **Validate**: Timeline estimates against technical complexity
- **Assess**: Resource allocation matches technical requirements  
- **Output**: Updated milestone timeline and resource plan

### Phase 3: Future Planning & Risk Mitigation (30 minutes)

#### Next Release Definition (15 min)
- **Define**: Release theme and primary value proposition
- **Set**: Success metrics and quality gates  
- **Confirm**: Scope boundaries and MVP criteria

#### Risk Assessment & Mitigation (15 min)
- **Identify**: Cross-functional risks (technical, design, operational)
- **Prioritize**: Highest impact risks to milestone delivery
- **Define**: Specific mitigation strategies and owners
- **Schedule**: Risk review and mitigation check-ins

### Phase 4: Outputs & Next Steps (15 minutes)

#### Documentation Updates
- **VRTM**: Update gap analysis, risk levels, milestone status
- **Roadmap**: Update timeline, scope, and success metrics
- **ADRs**: Schedule architecture decision documentation
- **Issues**: Create/update GitHub issues for new roadmap items

#### Communication Plan  
- **Stakeholders**: Key messages and update schedule
- **Team**: Implementation planning and sprint preparation
- **Documentation**: Update timelines and ownership
