## Prompts (copy once per role)
- Yesterday: What shipped or moved forward (PRs/issues/decisions)?
- Today: What’s next within 24 hours?
- Blockers: What’s at risk? What decision or context is needed?

## Roles

- Lead Architect
- Gameplay/Sim Engineer
- Networking/Gateway Engineer

## Definition of Done
