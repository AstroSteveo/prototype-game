## Pre-Session Preparation Status

### Documents Reviewed âœ…
- [x] [Game Design Document](../../product/vision/game-design-document.md) - Current vision and design pillars
- [x] [Technical Design Document](../../architecture/technical-design-document.md) - MVP milestones completed (M0-M5)
- [x] [VRTM](../traceability/VRTM.md) - Current gap analysis showing Post-MVP gaps
- [x] [Current Roadmap](../../product/roadmap/roadmap.md) - Release planning status

### Key Pre-Session Findings

**Current State Summary**:
- âœ… **MVP Complete**: All M0-M5 milestones delivered successfully
- âœ… **Core Infrastructure**: Local sharding, AOI, bots, persistence working
- ðŸ”´ **Post-MVP Gap**: Equipment, skills, targeting, inventory systems not started
- ðŸŸ¡ **Vision Alignment**: Need to validate post-MVP direction supports design pillars

**Critical Questions for Workshop**:
1. Do the 5 design pillars still guide our technical decisions for post-MVP?
2. How do we prioritize equipment vs. skills vs. targeting for next release?
3. What are the resource constraints and timeline for post-MVP systems?
4. Which technical risks need mitigation before post-MVP development?

## Session Execution

### Phase 1: Current State Assessment (45 minutes)

#### Vision Validation Results (15 min)
**Review Question**: Are design pillars still accurate and achievable?

**Findings**:
- âœ… **Seamless World**: Fully delivered through local sharding (M3)
- âœ… **Always a Crowd**: Successfully implemented with bot density system (M4)
- âœ… **Respect Time**: Quick reconnect and persistence working (M5)
- âœ… **Fair Play**: Server-authoritative simulation stable (M1)
- ðŸŸ¡ **Meaningful Loadouts**: Not yet implemented - this is our next major focus

**Decision**: All design pillars remain valid. "Meaningful Loadouts" becomes the primary theme for next release.

#### Requirements Gap Analysis Results (15 min)
**Current Gaps from VRTM Analysis**:

| Priority | Gap | Impact | User Story Blocked |
|----------|-----|--------|-------------------|
| High | Equipment System | Core user experience | "I loot a weapon upgrade, equip it, and feel its stats reflected" |
| High | Skill Progression | Character advancement | "My skill line shows increased XP and new stanza options" |
| High | Targeting System | Combat readiness | "I tab-target an enemy and read their relative difficulty" |
| Medium | Inventory UI | Equipment management | User experience for loadout management |
| Medium | Combat Resolution | Ability execution | Combat user stories blocked |

**Decision**: Focus on High priority gaps for next release (Post-MVP Phase 1).

#### Technical Readiness Review (15 min)
**Infrastructure Status**:
- âœ… **Foundation**: All MVP systems stable and performing within targets
- âœ… **Database Schema**: Ready for extension with inventory/equipment tables
- âœ… **Network Protocol**: Can accommodate new message types for equipment/skills
- ðŸŸ¡ **Testing Infrastructure**: Need integration tests for post-MVP systems
- ðŸŸ¡ **Performance Budget**: Need validation under equipment/skill system load

**Decision**: Technical foundation is solid for post-MVP development.

### Phase 2: Alignment Deep Dive (90 minutes)

#### Vision â†” Requirements Mapping Results (30 min)
**"Meaningful Loadouts" Pillar Breakdown**:

| Vision Element | Requirements | Priority | Implementation Component |
|----------------|--------------|----------|-------------------------|
| Constrained inventory | Weight/bulk system | High | Inventory management |
| Explicit equipment slots | Hand/armor/tool slots | High | Equipment system |
| Clear target intel | Difficulty display | High | Targeting system |
| Interesting choices | Skill requirements | High | Skill progression |

**Conflicts Resolved**:
- None identified - requirements directly support the vision pillar

#### Requirements â†” Technical Design Mapping Results (30 min)
**Technical Systems Required**:

| Requirement | Technical Component | Complexity | Dependencies |
|-------------|-------------------|------------|--------------|
| Equipment slots | Database schema + server validation | Medium | None |
| Weight/bulk limits | Encumbrance calculation + movement penalties | Medium | Equipment system |
| Skill requirements | Skill validation + gating system | High | Equipment + Skill systems |
| Target difficulty | Level calculation + color coding | Low | Targeting system |
| Combat stats | Damage type + mitigation calculation | High | Equipment + Combat systems |

**Technical Risks Identified**:
- Equipment and skill systems are highly interdependent
- Combat resolution requires careful balance between systems
- Performance impact of real-time encumbrance calculations

#### Technical Design â†” Roadmap Mapping Results (30 min)
**Milestone Sequencing for Post-MVP**:

1. **M6 - Equipment Foundation** (4-5 weeks)
   - Equipment slots and basic equip/unequip
   - Simple stat effects (no combat yet)
   - Database schema and persistence

2. **M7 - Skill System** (3-4 weeks)
   - XP pipeline and skill progression
   - Skill requirements for equipment
   - Stanza unlocking framework

3. **M8 - Targeting & Combat** (4-5 weeks)
   - Target selection and difficulty display
   - Basic combat resolution with damage types
   - Equipment stats affecting combat

4. **M9 - Integration & Polish** (2-3 weeks)
   - Full inventory UI integration
