# Roadmap Planning Update - September 16, 2025

## Summary

This update captures the outcomes of the roadmap planning meeting documented in [Issue #109](https://github.com/AstroSteveo/prototype-game/issues/109), implementing the "Full MVP Loop and Persistence" release plan.

## Updated Documents

### 1. docs/roadmap/ROADMAP.md
- **Updated timeline**: 10-week schedule with M5, M6, M7 milestones
- **Status snapshot**: Reflects current state (M3/M4 complete, M5-M7 planned)
- **Risk assessment**: Updated based on persistence and team capacity concerns
- **Success metrics**: Added specific targets for inventory, targeting, and <2s reconnect

### 2. docs/dev/ROADMAP_IMPLEMENTATION.md (NEW)
- **Technical requirements**: Detailed codebase changes for M5-M7
- **Implementation schedule**: Week-by-week breakdown
- **Code examples**: Interfaces and data structures for new features
- **Testing strategy**: Unit, integration, and performance test requirements
- **Infrastructure needs**: PostgreSQL, Redis, and CI/CD extensions

### 3. README.md
- **Quick links**: Added implementation guide and Issue #109 reference
- **Updated roadmap reference**: Points to September 2025 timeline

## Key Decisions Documented

### Release Theme: "Full MVP Loop and Persistence"
- **M5 (Weeks 1-3)**: Inventory & Equipment MVP vertical slice
- **M6 (Weeks 4-6)**: Targeting & Skills MVP vertical slice  
- **M7 (Weeks 7-9)**: Persistence DB integration with <2s reconnect
- **Week 10**: Auth hardening, observability, stretch goals

### Technical Priorities
1. **Database Integration**: PostgreSQL/Redis for persistence layer
2. **Feature Vertical Slices**: End-to-end functionality for inventory → equipment → targeting → skills
3. **Performance Targets**: Maintain <250ms handover, achieve <2s reconnect
4. **Technical Debt**: Address inventory/equipment, targeting, and DB layer gaps

### Risk Mitigations
- Technical design sessions for complex features (DB, inventory, skills)
- PostgreSQL setup for dev/CI environments early in timeline
- Strict MVP criteria to prevent scope creep
- Buffer time for team capacity constraints

## No Code Changes Required

This update focused purely on documentation to capture roadmap planning outcomes. The codebase remains unchanged and all existing tests continue to pass. Implementation of the features outlined in the roadmap will happen in subsequent development cycles following the established timeline.

## Validation

- ✅ All existing tests pass (`make fmt vet test test-ws`)
- ✅ Documentation cross-references are consistent
- ✅ Roadmap timeline aligns with issue #109 outcomes
- ✅ Implementation guide provides actionable technical guidance
