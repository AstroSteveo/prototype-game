### ⚠️ Risk Assessment for Next Release

#### 🟡 MEDIUM RISKS - REQUIRE MITIGATION

1. **Feature Complexity Risk**
   - **Impact**: High - M5-M7 introduce multiple new complex systems
   - **Probability**: Medium - Well-defined but significant development
   - **Mitigation**: Technical design sessions, MVP-first approach, incremental delivery

2. **Timeline Ambition Risk**
   - **Impact**: Medium - 10-week timeline for 3 major milestones
   - **Probability**: Medium - Depends on team capacity and complexity
   - **Mitigation**: Buffer time, strict MVP scope, parallel development tracks

3. **Integration Complexity Risk**
   - **Impact**: Medium - Database integration affects multiple systems
   - **Probability**: Medium - PostgreSQL setup and schema design
   - **Mitigation**: Early prototyping, dev environment parity, incremental migration

#### 🟢 LOW RISKS - WELL-MANAGED

1. **Technical Foundation**: Strong codebase provides solid foundation
2. **Performance**: Current metrics indicate headroom for additional features
3. **Testing Infrastructure**: Comprehensive test suite supports safe iteration
4. **Documentation**: Clear specifications reduce implementation uncertainty

## Recommendations

### 🚀 PROCEED - With Risk Mitigations

**Primary Recommendation**: **APPROVE** roadmap progression with the following **mandatory risk mitigations**:

#### 1. Implement Incremental Delivery Strategy
- **Week 1-2**: Technical design sessions for all M5-M7 features
- **Week 3-4**: M5 vertical slice MVP (inventory core only)
- **Week 5-6**: M6 vertical slice MVP (basic targeting + XP)
- **Week 7-8**: M7 minimal viable persistence
- **Week 9-10**: Integration, polish, and stretch goals

#### 2. Establish Success Checkpoints
- **Week 2**: M5 design approval and acceptance criteria finalization
- **Week 4**: M5 vertical slice demo and M6 design review
- **Week 6**: M6 demo and M7 PostgreSQL environment ready
- **Week 8**: Full persistence pipeline working

#### 3. Scope Management Controls
- **Strict MVP Focus**: Defer all non-essential features to post-M7
- **Buffer Time**: Reserve week 9-10 for integration and unexpected complexity
- **Feature Gates**: Implement feature flags for new systems to reduce risk

#### 4. Technical Risk Mitigations
- **PostgreSQL Early Setup**: Complete dev and CI environment setup in Week 1
- **Database Design First**: Schema and migration strategy before implementation
- **Parallel Development**: Inventory and targeting systems can develop in parallel

### 📋 Decision Framework

Use this framework for go/no-go decisions at each checkpoint:

| Checkpoint | Go Criteria | No-Go Actions |
|------------|-------------|---------------|
| **Week 2** | M5 design approved, PostgreSQL setup complete | Extend design phase, reassess timeline |
| **Week 4** | M5 vertical slice working, M6 design solid | Focus on M5 completion, defer M6 complexity |
| **Week 6** | M6 basic flow working, M7 environment ready | Prioritize working features, reduce M7 scope |
| **Week 8** | Persistence pipeline functional | Focus on integration, defer stretch goals |

## Conclusion

The prototype-game project demonstrates **excellent technical foundation** and **mature development practices**. The successful completion of M0-M4 milestones with all performance targets met indicates a **high-capability development approach**.
