# Documentation Guidelines

## Instruction Scope
- Applies to the `docs/` tree.

## Structure
- `design/` – game and technical design docs.
- `dev/` – developer guide and workflow tips.
- `process/` – feature workflow and architectural decision records.

## Guidelines
- Use Markdown with clear, concise language.
- Cross-link related documents when helpful.
- Feature proposals follow `process/FEATURE_PROPOSAL.md`.
- ADRs use `process/adr/TEMPLATE.md` and live in `process/adr/`.
- Doc-only changes do not require running Go builds or tests.
