# Design Systems Refresh Template

Use this checklist when the game or technical design documents need to be updated for new MMO systems.

## Summary
_Describe the design areas being refreshed and the player value the update unlocks._

## Scope
- Update the [Game Design Document](game-design-document.md) with revised player-facing experience notes, including UX flows and references.
- Update the [Technical Design Document](../../architecture/technical-design-document.md) with data models, protocol messages, and server flows.
- Capture telemetry, testing, and security implications introduced by the change.

## Definition of Done
- Game and technical design documents reflect the new mechanics with citations or external references where helpful.
- Assumptions and open questions are clearly labeled for future review.
- Supporting diagrams, message schemas, and data tables are refreshed.
- Roadmap and implementation artifacts link back to the updated sections.

## Notes & Follow-ups
- Call out dependencies (client work, infrastructure, balancing) and create issues for each owner.
- Ensure [`.github/instructions/`](../../../.github/instructions/) has any new governance or workflow expectations that emerge from the design.

Duplicate this template when opening issues or tasks so design work stays consistent and traceable.
