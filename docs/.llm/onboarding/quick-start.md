# LLM Quick-Start

Follow this checklist before making changes or responding to requests.

1. **Confirm the task** — Re-read the latest human instructions, relevant issues, and repository-level `AGENTS.md` files.
2. **Collect context** — Skim `docs/README.md`, the roadmap handbook, and any files under `docs/process/sessions/` that apply to the task.
3. **Inventory dependencies** — Note required commands, build tags, or scripts from the [Developer Guide](../../development/developer-guide.md).
4. **Plan edits** — Outline the files you intend to touch; verify each path’s instructions (check for nested `AGENTS.md`).
5. **Execute carefully** — Apply changes in small, reviewable commits; avoid speculative edits outside the task scope.
6. **Validate** — Run the prescribed commands (tests, linters) and document results in the PR or summary.
7. **Summarize** — Produce a concise changelog referencing updated docs and link to supporting evidence.

Revisit this quick-start whenever repository conventions evolve.
