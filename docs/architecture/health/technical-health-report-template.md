# Technical Health Report Template

Use this template to document the codebase and infrastructure health at regular intervals (e.g., quarterly or prior to major roadmap checkpoints).

- **Report Date**: _YYYY-MM-DD_
- **Analysis Scope**: _Subsystems or release focus_
- **Status**: ðŸŸ¢ Healthy / ðŸŸ¡ Watchlist / ðŸ”´ Action Required

## Build & Test Health
### Build Performance Metrics
Document the most recent build timings and include the commands executed.
```
make fmt
make vet
go test ./...
go test -tags ws ./...
```
Record notable observations (e.g., cache misses, dependency updates).

### Test Suite Summary
Outline coverage and gaps.
- Number of packages with unit tests
- Integration suites exercised (e.g., WebSocket, persistence)
- Known flaky tests or areas without coverage

### Recent Test Execution
Provide the latest command output snippets, including failures or warnings that require follow-up.

## Performance Validation
Describe how the system performed under load or soak testing. Capture metrics such as tick rate, handover latency, reconnect time, and payload sizes. Compare results to targets documented in the [Technical Design Document](../technical-design-document.md).

## Operational Readiness
- **Service Health**: Document results from `make run`, health endpoints, and shutdown behavior.
- **Process Management**: Note PID/daemon handling, log rotation, and cleanup scripts.
- **Automation**: Summarize CI workflows, deployment tooling, and alerting coverage.

## Code Quality Assessment
### Code Structure
Highlight notable architecture qualities or areas accruing debt. Reference supporting ADRs or modules.

### Build & Dependency Hygiene
List Go version, module dependencies, and any pending upgrades.

### Test Architecture
Summarize major test harnesses (simulation, transport, persistence) and call out expansion opportunities.

## Documentation & Knowledge
- `../technical-design-document.md` and `../../product/vision/game-design-document.md` updated?
- [`../../development/developer-guide.md`](../../development/developer-guide.md) reflects new workflows?
- ADRs and process docs in `../../process/` reviewed during this period?

## Security & Reliability
### Security Baseline
Track authentication, authorization, data handling, and audit logging posture. Note any outstanding work.

### Error Handling
Summarize resilience patterns (timeouts, retries, panic recovery) and known weak spots.

### Observability
List available dashboards, metrics, traces, and log pipelines. Identify missing instrumentation aligned with roadmap goals.

## Follow-up Actions
Create a concise task list with owners and target dates. Link to GitHub issues where possible.

Keep completed reports in a dated folder to show trendlines over time.
