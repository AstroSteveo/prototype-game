---

## üöÄ Immediate Action Items (Next 7 Days)

### Priority 1: Enable Equipment Operations (Days 1-3)
```bash
# WebSocket message handlers needed:
- equip_item: Allow players to equip items from inventory
- unequip_item: Allow players to unequip items to inventory  
- move_item: Enable inventory management operations
```

### Priority 2: Enhanced Testing Client (Days 4-5)
```bash
# Extend existing wsprobe tool:
- Equipment operation commands
- Inventory display functionality
- Equipment status visualization
```

### Priority 3: Content Foundation (Days 6-7)
```bash
# Database integration:
- Item templates table schema
- Template loading on server start
- Basic content management endpoints
```

## üìà Strategic Recommendations

### Resource Reallocation (Critical)

**Before Discovery:**
- 75% Backend development (equipment, inventory, skills)
- 15% Client development
- 10% Content/operations

**After Discovery:**
- 25% Backend maintenance/optimization
- 50% Client development (Unity/Godot/web)
- 25% Content creation and management tools

### Timeline Impact

**Original M6-M8 Plan**: 13-17 weeks backend development  
**Revised Timeline**: 4-6 weeks client enablement  
**Time Savings**: 9-11 weeks (65% reduction)

### Investment Priorities

1. **Client Development**: Highest ROI - unlocks existing sophisticated backend
2. **Content Tools**: High ROI - enables game design iteration
3. **Advanced Features**: Medium ROI - builds on solid foundation
4. **Infrastructure**: Low ROI - already excellent

---

## üîß Technical Integration Points

### Existing WebSocket Protocol (Ready to Extend)
```json
// Current join response includes equipment data:
{
  "type": "join_ack",
  "data": {
    "inventory": {"items": [], "compartment_caps": {...}},
    "equipment": {"slots": {}},
    "skills": {},
    "encumbrance": {...}
  }
}
```

### Required Client Message Handlers
```javascript
// Equipment operations (backend ready, need client handlers)
ws.send(JSON.stringify({
  type: "equip_item", 
  data: {item_id: "sword_001", slot: "main_hand"}
}));

ws.send(JSON.stringify({
  type: "unequip_item",
  data: {slot: "main_hand"}
}));
```
