#### 2. Visual Client Prototype (Weeks 2-3)
**Priority**: HIGH  
- Unity/Godot client with inventory and equipment UI
- Basic drag-drop inventory management
- Equipment stat visualization

**Why High**: Enables stakeholder validation and player testing

#### 3. Content Creation Tools (Week 4)
**Priority**: MEDIUM
- Database storage for item templates
- Basic content management interface
- Template validation and testing tools

**Why Medium**: Supports game design iteration and balancing

### Medium-Term Roadmap (Next 90 Days)

#### Combat System Integration
- Implement combat resolution using existing equipment framework
- Damage calculation with equipment bonuses
- Status effects and combat modifiers

#### Advanced Client Features
- Polished inventory management interface
- Equipment comparison and optimization tools
- Real-time combat feedback and animations

#### Content Pipeline Maturation
- Content designer workflows and tools
- Automated balancing and validation
- Content versioning and deployment systems

### Long-Term Strategic Direction

#### Platform Expansion
- Client platform diversification (web, mobile)
- Cross-platform progression and state sync
- Social features and guild systems

#### Advanced Gameplay
- Complex ability systems with equipment interactions
- Dynamic world events and content
- Player-driven economy and crafting

## Resource Optimization Recommendations

### Development Focus Shift

#### From: Backend Infrastructure Development (75% effort planned)
**Status**: COMPLETE - No additional backend work needed for M6-M8

#### To: Client and Experience Development (75% effort recommended)
**Rationale**: Sophisticated backend needs player-facing interfaces

#### Cost-Benefit Analysis
- **Development Time Saved**: 3-4 months of backend work
- **Risk Reduction**: Proven systems vs. planned implementations  
- **Value Creation**: Focus on player experience vs. technical infrastructure
- **Resource Efficiency**: Reallocate backend developers to client/content work

### Team Structure Recommendations

#### Current Optimal Team Composition
- **1x Backend Developer**: Maintenance, API additions, performance optimization
- **2x Client Developers**: Unity/Godot development, UI/UX implementation
- **1x Game Designer**: Content creation, balancing, player experience
- **0.5x DevOps**: Infrastructure, deployment, monitoring

#### Previous vs. Optimal Resource Allocation
| Role | Previous Plan | Discovered Optimal | Efficiency Gain |
|------|---------------|-------------------|-----------------|
| Backend Dev | 75% | 25% | 200% efficiency |
| Client Dev | 15% | 50% | 233% focus increase |
| Game Design | 5% | 20% | 300% focus increase |
| DevOps | 5% | 5% | No change |
