# AOI Neighborhood and Epsilon Validation Report (T-021)

## Summary

This document validates the Area of Interest (AOI) 3x3 cell neighborhood and epsilon tolerance implementation in the prototype game backend. The validation confirms that the implementation meets the requirements R9-R10 mentioned in the task description.

## Implementation Analysis

### Current AOI Implementation
The AOI system is implemented in `backend/internal/sim/engine.go` in the `QueryAOI` method:

```go
func (e *Engine) QueryAOI(pos spatial.Vec2, radius float64, excludeID string) []Entity {
    // Determine world cell of the position to build a 3x3 neighborhood query.
    cx, cz := spatial.WorldToCell(pos.X, pos.Z, e.cfg.CellSize)
    center := spatial.CellKey{Cx: cx, Cz: cz}
    neigh := spatial.Neighbors3x3(center)
    r2 := radius * radius
    const eps = 1e-9 // tolerance to avoid flapping from FP roundoff at the boundary
    // ... query entities in 3x3 neighborhood with epsilon tolerance
}
```

### Key Components Validated

#### 1. 3x3 Cell Neighborhood Query ✅
- **Implementation**: Uses `spatial.Neighbors3x3()` to get all 9 cells in 3x3 grid
- **Coverage**: Queries entities from center cell and all 8 surrounding cells
- **Validation**: Comprehensive tests confirm all entities in 3x3 neighborhood are found

#### 2. Epsilon Tolerance ✅
- **Value**: `eps = 1e-9` (1 nanosecond precision)
- **Purpose**: Prevents floating-point precision issues at AOI boundaries
- **Application**: Added to radius check: `distance² <= radius² + epsilon`
- **Validation**: Boundary edge cases verified to work correctly

#### 3. Boundary Case Handling ✅
- **Inclusive Boundaries**: Entities exactly at radius boundary are included
- **Cross-Cell Queries**: Entities in adjacent cells within radius are found
- **Floating-Point Precision**: Edge cases near boundaries handled correctly
- **No Duplicates**: No duplicate entity IDs returned across cell boundaries

## Test Coverage

### Existing Tests (All Passing)
1. `TestAOI_InclusiveBoundaryAndExclusion` - Validates boundary inclusion/exclusion
2. `TestAOI_CoversAcrossBorder_NoFlap` - Tests cross-border visibility
3. `TestAOI3x3CellQuery` - Validates 3x3 neighborhood coverage
4. `TestContinuousAOIAcrossBorderWithStaticNeighbors` - Cross-border continuity
5. `TestAOIRebuildTimingRequirement` - Performance requirements
6. `TestNoDuplicateEntityIDs` - Duplicate ID prevention

### New Comprehensive Tests Added
1. `TestEpsilonToleranceAtBoundary` - Validates epsilon tolerance implementation
2. `Test3x3CellNeighborhoodCoverage` - Comprehensive 3x3 cell coverage validation
3. `TestAOICellBoundaryPrecision` - Cell boundary precision edge cases
4. `TestAOIPerformanceWithLargeCellCounts` - Performance under load

## Validation Results

### ✅ All Tests Passing
- **Total AOI Tests**: 10 test functions
- **Test Results**: 100% pass rate
- **Coverage**: Epsilon tolerance, 3x3 neighborhood, boundary cases, performance

### ✅ Epsilon Tolerance Verified
- Entities exactly at radius boundary: **Included** ✅
- Entities just inside radius: **Included** ✅  
- Entities just outside radius (within epsilon): **Included** ✅
- Entities clearly outside radius: **Excluded** ✅
- Floating-point precision edge cases: **Handled correctly** ✅

### ✅ 3x3 Neighborhood Coverage Verified
- All 9 cells in 3x3 grid: **Queried** ✅
- Entities within radius across cells: **Found** ✅
- Query player excluded from own results: **Verified** ✅
- Cross-boundary entity visibility: **Continuous** ✅
- Performance with 180 entities in neighborhood: **Efficient** ✅

### ✅ Boundary Cases Verified
- Queries on exact cell boundaries: **Working** ✅
- Entities across cell boundaries: **Visible** ✅
- Corner positions (4-cell intersections): **Handled** ✅
- Epsilon precision at boundaries: **Applied correctly** ✅

## Performance Characteristics

- **Query Efficiency**: O(1) cell lookup + O(entities_in_3x3) filtering
- **Memory Usage**: Minimal temporary allocation for results
- **Epsilon Impact**: Negligible performance overhead (simple addition)
- **Scalability**: Tested with 180 entities across 3x3 grid - excellent performance

## Conclusion

The AOI implementation fully satisfies the requirements for T-021:

1. **✅ 3x3 Cell Neighborhood**: Properly implemented using spatial partitioning
