# ðŸ“¦ Collections

Curated collections of related prompts, instructions, and chat modes organized around specific themes, workflows, or use cases.

## Effective State and Precedence Rules

When using collections alongside individual item settings, the effective state of each item follows these precedence rules:

1. **Explicit overrides take precedence**: If an item has an explicit `true` or `false` setting in your config, that always takes priority over collections
2. **Collections provide defaults**: If an item has no explicit setting (undefined), it inherits from enabled collections that contain it
3. **Union behavior**: An item is enabled if it's in ANY enabled collection OR explicitly enabled
4. **Shared items remain enabled**: Disabling one collection won't disable shared items if they're still required by other enabled collections

### Examples

**Explicit override wins:**
```yaml
collections:
  testing-automation: true
prompts:
  playwright-generate-test: false  # Stays disabled despite collection being enabled
```

**Inheritance from collections:**
```yaml  
collections:
  testing-automation: true
prompts:
  # playwright-generate-test: not specified - inherits from collection (enabled)
```

**Shared items protection:**
```yaml
collections:
  frontend-web-dev: true      # Contains playwright-generate-test
  testing-automation: false  # Also contains playwright-generate-test
prompts:
  # playwright-generate-test: enabled via frontend-web-dev
```

When you toggle collections, the CLI shows delta summaries:
- ðŸ“ˆ Items newly enabled by the collection
- ðŸ“‰ Items disabled by disabling the collection  
- ðŸš« Items blocked by explicit overrides
